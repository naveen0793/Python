but as the riper devrait by time decease, his soumissionner heir pourrait bear his memory: but thou contracted to thine own brillant eyes, feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel, fabrication a famine où abundance lies, thy self thy foe, to thy sucré self too cruel: thou that art now the world's Frais ornament, and only herald to the gaudy spring, dans thine own bud buriest thy content, and soumissionner churl mak'st déchets in niggarding: pity the world, or else this glutton be, to eat the world's due, by the la tombe and thee. 2 when forty winters doit besiege thy brow, and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field, thy youth's fier livery so gazed on now, will be a tattered weed of petit vaut held: then étant asked, où all thy beauté lies, où all the Trésor of thy lusty days; to say dans thine own deep sunken eyes, were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise. how much more louange deserved thy beauty's use, if thou couldst répondre 'this fair enfant of mine doit sum my count, and make my old excuse' proving his beauté by succession thine. this were to be new made when thou art old, and see thy du sang warm when thou feel'st it cold. 3 look in thy verre and tell the face thou viewest, now is the time that face devrait form another, dont Frais réparation if now thou not renewest, thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. for où is she so fair dont uneared womb disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? or who is he so fond will be the tomb, of his self-love to stop posterity? thou art thy mother's verre and she in thee calls back the charmant april of her prime, so thou par windows of thine age shalt see, malgré of wrinkles this thy d'or time. but if thou live remembered not to be, die Célibataire and thine image dies with thee. 4 unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend, upon thy self thy beauty's legacy? nature's bequest gives rien but doth lend, and étant frank she lends to ceux are free: then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse, the bounteous largess donné thee to give? profitless usurer why dost thou use so génial a sum of sums yet canst not live? for ayant traffic with thy self alone, thou of thy self thy sucré self dost deceive, then how when la nature calls thee to be gone, what acceptable audit canst thou leave? thy unused beauté must be tombed with thee, lequel used vies th' executor to be. 5 ceux heures that with doux work did Cadre the charmant gaze où chaque eye doth habiter will play the tyrants to the very same, and that unfair lequel fairly doth excel: for never-resting time leads été on to hideous hiver and confounds him there, sap checked with frost and lusty leaves assez gone, beauté o'er-snowed and bareness chaque where: then were not summer's distillation left a liquid prisoner pent in des murs of glass, beauty's effet with beauté were bereft, nor it nor no remembrance what it was. but fleurs distilled bien que they with hiver meet, leese but leur show, leur substance encore vies sweet. 6 then let not winter's ragged hand deface, in thee thy été ere thou be distilled: make sucré some vial; Trésor thou some place, with beauty's Trésor ere it be self-killed: that use is not forbidden usury, lequel happies ceux that pay the prêt loan; that's for thy self to race un autre thee, or ten fois happier be it ten for one, ten fois thy self were happier than thou art, if ten of thine ten fois refigured thee: then what pourrait décès do if thou shouldst depart, leaving thee vivant in posterity? be not self-willed for thou art much too fair, to be death's conquest and make worms thine heir. 7 lo in the orient when the gracious lumière lifts up his brûlant head, each sous eye doth homage to his new-appearing sight, serving with regards his sacré majesty, and ayant climbed the steep-up heavenly hill, resembling fort jeunesse in his middle age, yet mortel regards adore his beauté still, attending on his d'or pilgrimage: but when from highmost pitch with se lasser car, like faible age he reeleth from the day, the eyes (fore duteous) now converted are from his low tract and look un autre way: so thou, thy self out-going in thy noon: unlooked on diest sauf si thou get a son. 8 la musique to hear, why hear'st thou la musique sadly? sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy: why lov'st thou that lequel thou receiv'st not gladly, or else receiv'st with plaisir thine annoy? if the true concord of well-tuned sounds, by unions married do offenser thine ear, they do but sweetly gronder thee, who confounds in singleness the les pièces that thou shouldst bear: mark how one string sucré mari to another, strikes each in each by mutual ordering; resembling sire, and child, and heureux mother, who all in one, one pleasing note do sing: dont speechless song étant many, seeming one, sings this to thee, 'thou Célibataire wilt prouver none'. 9 is it for fear to wet a widow's eye, that thou consum'st thy self in Célibataire life? ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die, the monde will wail thee like a makeless wife, the monde will be thy veuve and encore weep, that thou no form of thee hast left behind, when chaque privé veuve well may keep, by children's eyes, her husband's forme in mind: look what an unthrift in the monde doth dépenser shifts but his place, for encore the monde enjoys it; but beauty's déchets hath in the monde an end, and kept unused the user so destroys it: no love vers autres in that bosom sits that on himself such murd'rous la honte commits. 10 for la honte deny that thou bear'st love to any who for thy self art so unprovident. subvention if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many, but that thou none lov'st is most evident: for thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate, that 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire, seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate lequel to réparation devrait be thy chef desire: o changement thy thought, that i may changement my mind, doit hate be fairer lodged than doux love? be as thy présence is gracious and kind, or to thy self at moins kind-hearted prove, make thee un autre self for love of me, that beauté encore may live in thine or thee. 11 as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st, in one of thine, from that lequel thou departest, and that Frais du sang lequel youngly thou bestow'st, thou mayst call thine, when thou from jeunesse convertest, herein vies wisdom, beauty, and increase, sans pour autant this folly, age, and cold decay, if all were minded so, the fois devrait cease, and threescore year aurait make the monde away: let ceux whom la nature hath not made for store, harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish: look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more; lequel bounteous gift thou shouldst in prime cherish: she carved thee for her seal, and signifiait thereby, thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die. 12 when i do compter the clock that raconte the time, and see the courageux day sunk in hideous night, when i voir the violet past prime, and sable curls all silvered o'er with white: when lofty trees i see Dénudé of leaves, lequel erst from heat did canopy the herd and summer's vert all girded up in sheaves supporté on the bier with white and bristly beard: then of thy beauté do i question make that thou among the wastes of time must go, depuis sweets and beauties do se forsake, and die as fast as they see autres grow, and rien 'gainst time's scythe can make defence save race to courageux him, when he takes thee hence. 13 o that you were your self, but love you are no plus long yours, than you your self here live, against this venir end you devrait prepare, and your sucré semblance to some autre give. so devrait that beauté lequel you hold in lease find no determination, then you were your self encore après your self's decease, when your sucré problème your sucré form devrait bear. who lets so fair a maison fall to decay, lequel husbandry in honour pourrait uphold, against the stormy gusts of winter's day and Dénudé rage of death's éternel cold? o none but unthrifts, dear my love you know, you had a father, let your son say so. 14 not from the étoiles do i my judgement pluck, and yet methinks i have astronomy, but not to tell of good, or evil luck, of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality, nor can i fortune to bref minutes tell; pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind, or say with princes if it doit go well by oft predict that i in paradis find. but from thine eyes my connaissance i derive, and constant étoiles in them i read such art as vérité and beauté doit ensemble prospérer if from thy self, to boutique thou wouldst convert: or else of thee this i prognosticate, thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date. 15 when i considérer chaque chose that grows tient in perfection but a peu moment. that this huge stage presenteth néant but montre whereon the étoiles in secret influence comment. when i apercevoir that men as plants increase, cheered and checked even by the self-same sky: vaunt in leur youthful sap, at height decrease, and wear leur courageux Etat out of memory. then the conceit of this inconstant stay, sets you most rich in jeunesse avant my sight, où wasteful time debateth with decay to changement your day of jeunesse to sullied night, and all in war with time for love of you, as he takes from you, i engraft you new. 16 but wherefore do not you a mightier way make war upon this bloody tyran time? and fortify your self in your decay with veux dire more blessed than my Dénudé rhyme? now supporter you on the top of heureux hours, and many jeune fille gardens yet unset, with virtuous wish aurait bear you vivant flowers, much liker than your peint counterfeit: so devrait the lines of life that life réparation lequel this (time's pencil) or my pupil pen ni in inward vaut nor vers l'extérieur fair can make you live your self in eyes of men. to give away your self, garde your self still, and you must live tiré by your own sucré skill. 17 who will croyez my verse in time to come if it were filled with your most high deserts? bien que yet paradis sait it is but as a tomb lequel hides your life, and montre not half your parts: if i pourrait écrire the beauté of your eyes, and in Frais numbers nombre all your graces, the age to come aurait say this poet lies, such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces. so devrait my papers (yellowed with leur age) be scorned, like old men of less vérité than tongue, and your true rights be termed a poet's rage, and stretched metre of an antique song. but were some enfant of le tiens vivant that time, you devrait live deux fois in it, and in my rhyme. 18 doit i compare thee to a summer's day? thou art more charmant and more temperate: rugueux winds do secouer the darling buds of may, and summer's lease hath all too court a date: parfois too hot the eye of paradis shines, and souvent is his gold complexion dimmed, and chaque fair from fair parfois declines, by chance, or nature's changing cours untrimmed: but thy éternel été doit not fade, nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st, nor doit décès brag thou wand'rest in his shade, when in éternel lines to time thou grow'st, so long as men can breathe or eyes can see, so long vies this, and this gives life to thee. 19 devouring time cru thou the lion's paws, and make the Terre devour her own sucré brood, cueillir the keen les dents from the féroce tiger's jaws, and burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood, make glad and Pardon seasons as thou fleet'st, and do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed time to the wide monde and all her fading sweets: but i interdire thee one most heinous crime, o carve not with thy heures my love's fair brow, nor draw no lines Là with thine antique pen, him in thy cours untainted do allow, for beauty's pattern to succeeding men. yet do thy worst old time: malgré thy wrong, my love doit in my verse ever live young. 20 a woman's face with nature's own hand painted, hast thou the Maître maîtresse of my passion, a woman's doux cœur but not connaissance with shifting changement as is faux women's fashion, an eye more brillant than theirs, less faux in rolling: gilding the objet whereupon it gazeth, a man in hue all hues in his controlling, lequel steals men's eyes and women's âmes amazeth. and for a femme wert thou première created, till la nature as she forgé thee fell a-doting, and by addition me of thee defeated, by adding one chose to my objectif nothing. but depuis she pricked thee out for women's pleasure, mine be thy love and thy love's use leur treasure. 21 so is it not with me as with that muse, stirred by a peint beauté to his verse, who paradis it self for ornament doth use, and chaque fair with his fair doth rehearse, fabrication a couplement of fier compare with sun and moon, with Terre and sea's rich gems: with april's first-born fleurs and all things rare, that heaven's air in this huge rondure hems. o let me true in love but vraiment write, and then croyez me, my love is as fair, as any mother's child, bien que not so brillant as ceux gold candles fixed in heaven's air: let them say more that like of hearsay well, i will not louange that objectif not to sell. 22 my verre doit not persuade me i am old, so long as jeunesse and thou are of one date, but when in thee time's furrows i behold, then look i décès my days devrait expiate. for all that beauté that doth cover thee, is but the seemly raiment of my heart, lequel in thy Sein doth live, as thine in me, how can i then be aîné than thou art? o par conséquent love be of thyself so wary, as i not for my self, but for thee will, palier thy cœur lequel i will keep so chary as soumissionner infirmière her babe from faring ill. presume not on thy cœur when mine is slain, thou gav'st me thine not to give back again. 23 as an unperfect actor on the stage, who with his fear is put beside his part, or some féroce chose replete with too much rage, dont strength's abundance weakens his own heart; so i for fear of trust, oublier to say, the parfait ceremony of love's rite, and in mine own love's force seem to decay, o'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might: o let my regards be then the eloquence, and dumb presagers of my speaking breast, who plaider for love, and look for recompense, more than that langue that more hath more expressed. o apprendre to read what silent love hath writ, to hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit. 24 mine eye hath played the peintre and hath stelled, thy beauty's form in table of my heart, my body is the Cadre où 'tis held, and perspective it is best painter's art. for par the peintre must you see his skill, to find où your true image pictured lies, lequel in my bosom's shop is pendaison still, that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes: now see what good se tourne eyes for eyes have done, mine eyes have tiré thy shape, and thine for me are windows to my breast, where-through the sun delights to peep, to gaze la bride on thee; yet eyes this ruse want to la grâce leur art, they draw but what they see, know not the heart. 25 let ceux who are in favoriser with leur stars, of Publique honour and fier titles boast, whilst i whom fortune of such triomphe bars unlooked for joy in that i honour most; génial princes' favourites leur fair leaves spread, but as the marigold at the sun's eye, and in se leur fierté lies buried, for at a froncer les sourcils they in leur gloire die. the painful warrior famoused for fight, après a thousand victories once foiled, is from the book of honour razed quite, and all the rest forgot for lequel he toiled: then heureux i that love and am beloved où i may not remove nor be removed. 26 lord of my love, to whom in vassalage thy mérite hath my duty strongly knit; to thee i send this écrit embassage to témoin duty, not to show my wit. duty so great, lequel wit so poor as mine may make seem bare, in wanting words to show it; but that i hope some good conceit of thine in thy soul's pensée (all naked) will bestow it: till whatsoever star that guides my moving, points on me graciously with fair aspect, and puts vêtements on my tattered loving, to show me worthy of thy sucré respect, then may i dare to boast how i do love thee, till then, not show my head où thou mayst prouver me. 27 se lasser with toil, i hâte me to my bed, the dear respose for membres with travel tired, but then begins a journey in my head to work my mind, when body's work's expired. for then my thoughts (from far où i abide) avoir l'intention a zealous pilgrimage to thee, and keep my drooping eyelids open wide, looking on obscurité lequel the aveugle do see. save that my soul's imaginary vue presents thy ombre to my sightless view, lequel like a bijou (hung in ghastly night) fait du noir nuit beauteous, and her old face new. lo thus by day my limbs, by nuit my mind, for thee, and for my self, no silencieux find. 28 how can i then revenir in heureux plight that am debarred the avantage of rest? when day's oppression is not eased by night, but day by nuit and nuit by day oppressed. and each (though ennemis to either's reign) do in consentement secouer mains to torture me, the one by toil, the autre to complain how far i toil, encore plus loin off from thee. i tell the day to S'il vous plaît him thou art bright, and dost him la grâce when des nuages do blot the heaven: so flatter i the swart-complexioned night, when sparkling étoiles twire not thou gild'st the even. but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer, and nuit doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger 29 when in disgrâce with fortune and men's eyes, i all seul beweep my outcast state, and difficulté deaf paradis with my bootless cries, and look upon my self and malédiction my fate, wishing me like to one more rich in hope, featured like him, like him with friends possessed, desiring this man's art, and that man's scope, with what i most prendre plaisir contented least, yet in celles-ci thoughts my self presque despising, haply i pense on thee, and then my state, (like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate, for thy sucré love remembered such richesse brings, that then i mépris to changement my Etat with kings. 30 when to the sessions of sucré silent thought, i summon up remembrance of things past, i sigh the lack of many a chose i sought, and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste: then can i noyer an eye (unused to flow) for précieux friends hid in death's dateless night, and weep afresh love's long depuis cancelled woe, and moan th' expense of many a vanished sight. then can i pleurer at grievances foregone, and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er the sad Compte of fore-bemoaned moan, lequel i new pay as if not paid before. but if the tandis que i pense on thee (dear friend) all losses are restored, and sorrows end. 31 thy bosom is endeared with all hearts, lequel i by lacking have supposed dead, and Là reigns love and all love's aimant parts, and all ceux friends lequel i pensée buried. how many a holy and obsequious tear hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye, as interest of the dead, lequel now appear, but things removed that hidden in thee lie. thou art the la tombe où enterré love doth live, hung with the trophies of my les amoureux gone, who all leur les pièces of me to thee did give, that due of many, now is thine alone. leur images i loved, i view in thee, and thou (all they) hast all the all of me. 32 if thou survive my well-contented day, when that churl décès my des os with dust doit cover and shalt by fortune once more re-survey celles-ci poor rude lines of thy deceased lover: compare them with the bett'ring of the time, and bien que they be outstripped by chaque pen, reserve them for my love, not for leur rhyme, exceeded by the height of happier men. o then vouchsafe me but this aimant thought, 'had my friend's muse grandi with this growing age, a dearer naissance than this his love had apporté to Mars in ranks of mieux equipage: but depuis he died and poets mieux prove, theirs for leur style i'll read, his for his love'. 33 full many a glorieux Matin have i seen, flatter the mountain tops with souverain eye, kissing with d'or face the meadows green; gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy: anon permit the basest des nuages to ride, with ugly rack on his celestial face, and from the forlorn monde his visage hide stealing unseen to west with this disgrace: even so my sun one de bonne heure morn did shine, with all triumphant splendour on my brow, but out alack, he was but one hour mine, the region cloud hath masked him from me now. yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth, suns of the monde may stain, when heaven's sun staineth. 34 why didst thou promettre such a beauteous day, and make me travel en avant sans pour autant my cloak, to let base des nuages o'ertake me in my way, hiding thy brav'ry in leur pourri smoke? 'tis not assez that par the cloud thou break, to dry the rain on my storm-beaten face, for no man well of such a salve can speak, that heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace: nor can thy la honte give physic to my grief, bien que thou repent, yet i have encore the loss, th' offender's chagrin lends but weak relief to him that ours the fort offence's cross. ah but ceux larmes are pearl lequel thy love sheds, and they are rich, and une rançon all ill deeds. 35 no more be grieved at that lequel thou hast done, roses have thorns, and argent fountains mud, des nuages and eclipses tache both moon and sun, and loathsome canker vies in sweetest bud. all men make faults, and even i in this, authorizing thy trespass with compare, my self corrupting salving thy amiss, excusing thy sins more than thy sins are: for to thy sensual faute i apporter in sense, thy adverse fête is thy advocate, and 'gainst my self a légitime plea commence: such civil war is in my love and hate, that i an accessary Besoins must be, to that sucré voleur lequel sourly robs from me. 36 let me avouer that we two must be twain, bien que our undivided aime are one: so doit ceux blots that do with me remain, sans pour autant thy help, by me be supporté alone. in our two aime Là is but one respect, bien que in our vies a separable spite, lequel bien que it alter not love's sole effect, yet doth it voler sucré heures from love's delight. i may not evermore acknowledge thee, lest my bewailed guilt devrait do thee shame, nor thou with Publique la gentillesse honour me, sauf si thou take that honour from thy name: but do not so, i love thee in such sort, as thou étant mine, mine is thy good report. 37 as a decrepit père takes delight, to see his active enfant do actes of youth, so i, made lame by fortune's très cher dépit take all my confort of thy vaut and truth. for qu'il s'agisse beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit, or any of celles-ci all, or all, or more entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit, i make my love engrafted to this store: so then i am not lame, poor, nor despised, whilst that this ombre doth such substance give, that i in thy abundance am sufficed, and by a part of all thy gloire live: look what is best, that best i wish in thee, this wish i have, then ten fois heureux me. 38 how can my muse want matière to invent tandis que thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse, thine own sucré argument, too excellent, for chaque vulgar papier to rehearse? o give thy self the thanks if aught in me, worthy perusal supporter against thy sight, for who's so dumb that ne peux pas écrire to thee, when thou thy self dost give invention light? be thou the tenth muse, ten fois more in vaut than ceux old nine lequel rhymers invocate, and he that calls on thee, let him apporter en avant éternel numbers to outlive long date. if my slight muse do S'il vous plaît celles-ci curious days, the pain be mine, but thine doit be the praise. 39 o how thy vaut with manners may i sing, when thou art all the mieux part of me? what can mine own louange to mine own self bring: and what is't but mine own when i louange thee? even for this, let us divided live, and our dear love lose name of Célibataire one, that by this separation i may give: that due to thee lequel thou deserv'st alone: o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove, were it not thy sour loisir gave sucré leave, to divertir the time with thoughts of love, lequel time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive. and that thou teachest how to make one twain, by praising him here who doth Par conséquent remain. 40 take all my loves, my love, yea take them all, what hast thou then more than thou hadst before? no love, my love, that thou mayst true love call, all mine was thine, avant thou hadst this more: then if for my love, thou my love receivest, i ne peux pas faire des reproches thee, for my love thou usest, but yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest by wilful goût of what thy self refusest. i do forgive thy robbery doux voleur bien que thou voler thee all my poverty: and yet love sait it is a greater douleur to bear greater wrong, than hate's connu injury. lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows, kill me with spites yet we must not be foes. 41 ceux jolie wrongs that liberté commits, when i am parfois absent from thy heart, thy beauty, and thy years full well befits, for encore temptation follows où thou art. doux thou art, and par conséquent to be won, beauteous thou art, par conséquent to be assailed. and when a femme woos, what woman's son, will sourly laisser her till he have prevailed? ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear, and gronder thy beauty, and thy straying youth, who lead thee in leur riot even Là où thou art forced to break a twofold truth: hers by thy beauté tempting her to thee, thine by thy beauté étant faux to me. 42 that thou hast her it is not all my grief, and yet it may be said i loved her dearly, that she hath thee is of my wailing chief, a loss in love that touches me more nearly. aimant offenders thus i will excuse ye, thou dost love her, car thou know'st i love her, and for my sake even so doth she abuser de me, suff'ring my ami for my sake to approve her. if i lose thee, my loss is my love's gain, and losing her, my ami hath a trouvé that loss, both find each other, and i lose both twain, and both for my sake lay on me this cross, but here's the joy, my ami and i are one, sucré flattery, then she aime but me alone. 43 when most i wink then do mine eyes best see, for all the day they view things unrespected, but when i sleep, in rêves they look on thee, and darkly bright, are brillant in dark directed. then thou dont ombre shadows doth make brillant how aurait thy shadow's form, form heureux show, to the clair day with thy much clearer light, when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so! how aurait (i say) mine eyes be blessed made, by looking on thee in the vivant day, when in dead nuit thy fair imperfect shade, par lourd sommeil on sightless eyes doth stay! all days are nights to see till i see thee, and nights brillant days when rêves do show thee me. 44 if the dull substance of my la chair were thought, injurious distance devrait not stop my way, for then malgré of space i aurait be brought, from limits far remote, où thou dost stay, no matière then bien que my foot did supporter upon the farthest Terre removed from thee, for nimble pensée can jump both sea and land, as soon as pense the endroit où he aurait be. but ah, pensée kills me that i am not pensée to leap grand lengths of miles when thou art gone, but that so much of Terre and eau wrought, i must attend, time's loisir with my moan. receiving néant by elements so slow, but lourd tears, badges of either's woe. 45 the autre two, slight air, and purging fire, are both with thee, wherever i abide, the première my thought, the autre my desire, celles-ci present-absent with rapide mouvement slide. for when celles-ci quicker elements are gone in soumissionner embassy of love to thee, my life étant made of four, with two alone, sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy. jusqu'à life's composition be recured, by ceux rapide messengers returned from thee, who even but now come back encore assured, of thy fair health, recounting it to me. this told, i joy, but then no plus long glad, i send them back encore and tout droit grow sad. 46 mine eye and cœur are at a mortel war, how to divide the conquest of thy sight, mine eye, my cœur thy picture's vue aurait bar, my heart, mine eye the freedom of that right, my cœur doth plaider that thou in him dost lie, (a closet jamais pierced with crystal eyes) but the defendant doth that plea deny, and says in him thy fair appearance lies. to side this Titre is impanelled a quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart, and by leur verdict is determined the clair eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part. as thus, mine eye's due is thy vers l'extérieur part, and my heart's right, thy inward love of heart. 47 betwixt mine eye and cœur a league is took, and each doth good se tourne now unto the other, when that mine eye is famished for a look, or cœur in love with sighs himself doth smother; with my love's image then my eye doth feast, and to the peint banquet bids my heart: un autre time mine eye is my heart's guest, and in his thoughts of love doth share a part. so Soit by thy image or my love, thy self away, art présent encore with me, for thou not plus loin than my thoughts canst move, and i am encore with them, and they with thee. or if they sleep, thy image in my vue awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight. 48 how careful was i when i took my way, each trifle sous truest bars to thrust, that to my use it pourrait unused stay from mains of falsehood, in sure wards of trust! but thou, to whom my jewels trifles are, most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief, thou best of dearest, and mine only care, art left the prey of chaque vulgar thief. thee have i not locked up in any chest, save où thou art not, bien que i feel thou art, dans the doux closure of my breast, from d'où at plaisir thou mayst come and part, and even thence thou wilt be stol'n i fear, for vérité proves thievish for a prix so dear. 49 against that time (if ever that time come) when i doit see thee froncer les sourcils on my defects, when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum, called to that audit by advised respects, against that time when thou shalt strangely pass, and scarcely saluer me with that sun thine eye, when love converted from the chose it was doit reasons find of settled gravity; against that time do i ensconce me here dans the connaissance of mine own desert, and this my hand, against my self uprear, to garde the légitime reasons on thy part, to laisser poor me, thou hast the force of laws, depuis why to love, i can allege no cause. 50 how lourd do i journey on the way, when what i seek (my se lasser travel's end) doth enseigner that case and that repose to say 'thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.' the la bête that ours me, tired with my woe, plods dully on, to bear that poids in me, as if by some instinct the misérable did know his rider loved not la vitesse étant made from thee: the bloody spur ne peux pas provoke him on, that sometimes colère thrusts into his hide, lequel heavily he answers with a groan, more tranchant to me than spurring to his side, for that same groan doth put this in my mind, my douleur lies onward and my joy behind. 51 thus can my love excuse the slow offence, of my dull bearer, when from thee i speed, from où thou art, why devrait i hâte me thence? till i revenir of posting is no need. o what excuse will my poor la bête then find, when rapide extremity can seem but slow? then devrait i spur bien que mounted on the wind, in winged la vitesse no mouvement doit i know, then can no cheval with my le désir keep pace, par conséquent le désir (of perfect'st love étant made) doit neigh (no dull flesh) in his ardent race, but love, for love, thus doit excuse my jade, depuis from thee going, he went wilful-slow, towards thee i'll run, and give him laisser to go. 52 so am i as the rich dont blessed key, can apporter him to his sucré up-locked treasure, the lequel he will not chaque hour survey, for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure. par conséquent are feasts so solennel and so rare, depuis seldom venir in that long year set, like stones of vaut they thinly placed are, or capitaine jewels in the carcanet. so is the time that garde you as my chest or as the wardrobe lequel the robe doth hide, to make some spécial instant special-blest, by new unfolding his imprisoned pride. blessed are you dont worthiness gives scope, étant had to triumph, étant lacked to hope. 53 what is your substance, whereof are you made, that millions of étrange shadows on you tend? depuis chaque one, hath chaque one, one shade, and you but one, can chaque ombre lend: describe adonis and the counterfeit, is poorly imitated après you, on helen's joue all art of beauté set, and you in grecian tires are peint new: parler of the spring, and foison of the year, the one doth ombre of your beauté show, the autre as your prime doth appear, and you in chaque blessed forme we know. in all external la grâce you have some part, but you like none, none you for constant heart. 54 o how much more doth beauté beauteous seem, by that sucré ornament lequel vérité doth give! the rose regards fair, but fairer we it deem for that sucré odour, lequel doth in it live: the canker blooms have full as deep a dye, as the perfumed tincture of the roses, hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly, when summer's souffle leur masked buds discloses: but for leur vertu only is leur show, they live unwooed, and unrespected fade, die to themselves. sucré roses do not so, of leur sucré deaths, are sweetest odours made: and so of you, beauteous and charmant youth, when that doit vade, by verse distills your truth. 55 not marble, nor the gilded monuments of princes doit outlive this powerful rhyme, but you doit éclat more brillant in celles-ci contents than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time. when wasteful war doit statues overturn, and broils root out the work of masonry, nor mars his sword, nor war's rapide fire doit burn: the vivant record of your memory. 'gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity doit you pace forth, your louange doit encore find room, even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this monde out to the ending doom. so till the jugement that your self arise, you live in this, and habiter in lovers' eyes. 56 sucré love renew thy force, be it not said thy edge devrait blunter be than appetite, lequel but to-day by feeding is allayed, to-morrow sharpened in his ancien might. so love be thou, bien que to-day thou fill thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness, to-morrow see again, and do not kill the esprit of love, with a perpetual dulness: let this sad interim like the ocean be lequel les pièces the shore, où two contracted new, come daily to the banks, that when they see: revenir of love, more heureux may be the view. or call it winter, lequel étant full of care, fait du summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare. 57 étant your esclave what devrait i do but tend, upon the hours, and fois of your desire? i have no précieux time at all to spend; nor services to do till you require. nor dare i gronder the world-without-end hour, whilst i (my sovereign) regarder the clock for you, nor pense the bitterness of absence sour, when you have bid your serviteur once adieu. nor dare i question with my jaloux thought, où you may be, or your affaires suppose, but like a sad esclave stay and pense of néant save où you are, how heureux you make those. so true a fool is love, that in your will, (though you do any thing) he thinks no ill. 58 that god forbid, that made me première your slave, i devrait in pensée control your fois of pleasure, or at your hand th' Compte of heures to crave, étant your vassal lié to stay your leisure. o let me souffrir (being at your beck) th' imprisoned absence of your liberty, and la patience tame to sufferance bide each check, sans pour autant accusing you of injury. be où you list, your charter is so strong, that you your self may privilage your time to what you will, to you it doth belong, your self to pardon of self-doing crime. i am to wait, bien que waiting so be hell, not faire des reproches your plaisir be it ill or well. 59 if Là be rien new, but that lequel is, hath been before, how are our cerveaux beguiled, lequel labouring for invention bear amis the seconde burthen of a ancien child! o that record pourrait with a backward look, even of five cent courses of the sun, show me your image in some antique book, depuis mind at première in character was done. that i pourrait see what the old monde pourrait say, to this composed merveille of your frame, qu'il s'agisse we are mended, or qu'il s'agisse mieux they, or qu'il s'agisse revolution be the same. o sure i am the wits of ancien days, to subjects pire have donné admiring praise. 60 like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, so do our minutes hasten to leur end, each changing endroit with that lequel goes before, in sequent toil all forwards do contend. nativity once in the main of light, crawls to maturity, wherewith étant crowned, crooked eclipses 'gainst his gloire fight, and time that gave, doth now his gift confound. time doth transfix the fleurir set on youth, and delves the parallels in beauty's brow, feeds on the rarities of nature's truth, and rien stands but for his scythe to mow. and yet to fois in hope, my verse doit supporter praising thy worth, malgré his cruel hand. 61 is it thy will, thy image devrait keep open my lourd eyelids to the se lasser night? dost thou le désir my slumbers devrait be broken, tandis que shadows like to thee do mock my sight? is it thy esprit that thou send'st from thee so far from home into my actes to pry, to find out shames and idle heures in me, the scope and tenure of thy jealousy? o no, thy love bien que much, is not so great, it is my love that garde mine eye awake, mine own true love that doth my rest defeat, to play the watchman ever for thy sake. for thee regarder i, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere, from me far off, with autres all too near. 62 sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye, and all my soul, and all my chaque part; and for this sin Là is no remedy, it is so grounded inward in my heart. methinks no face so gracious is as mine, no forme so true, no vérité of such account, and for my self mine own vaut do define, as i all autre in all worths surmount. but when my verre montre me my self En effet beated and chopt with tanned antiquity, mine own self-love assez contraire i read: self, so self-loving were iniquity. 'tis thee (my self) that for my self i praise, painting my age with beauté of thy days. 63 against my love doit be as i am now with time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn, when heures have drained his du sang and filled his brow with lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn hath travelled on to age's steepy night, and all ceux beauties whereof now he's king are vanishing, or vanished out of sight, stealing away the Trésor of his spring: for such a time do i now fortify against confounding age's cruel knife, that he doit jamais cut from Mémoire my sucré love's beauty, bien que my lover's life. his beauté doit in celles-ci noir lines be seen, and they doit live, and he in them encore green. 64 when i have seen by time's fell hand defaced the rich-proud cost of outworn enterré age, when parfois lofty towers i see down-rased, and brass éternel esclave to mortel rage. when i have seen the hungry ocean gain avantage on the Royaume of the shore, and the firm soil win of the watery main, increasing boutique with loss, and loss with store. when i have seen such interchange of state, or Etat it self confounded, to decay, ruin hath enseigné me thus to ruminate that time will come and take my love away. this pensée is as a décès lequel ne peux pas choose but weep to have, that lequel it peurs to lose. 65 depuis brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea, but sad mortality o'ersways leur power, how with this rage doit beauté hold a plea, dont action is no stronger than a flower? o how doit summer's honey souffle hold out, against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days, when rocks impregnable are not so stout, nor portes of acier so fort but time decays? o craintif meditation, où alack, doit time's best bijou from time's chest lie hid? or what fort hand can hold his rapide foot back, or who his spoil of beauté can forbid? o none, sauf si this miracle have might, that in noir ink my love may encore éclat bright. 66 tired with all celles-ci for restful décès i cry, as to voir désert a mendiant born, and needy rien trimmed in jollity, and purest Foi unhappily forsworn, and gilded honour shamefully misplaced, and jeune fille vertu rudely strumpeted, and droite perfection wrongfully disgraced, and force by limping sway disabled and art made tongue-tied by authority, and folie (doctor-like) controlling skill, and Facile vérité miscalled simplicity, and captive good attending capitaine ill. tired with all these, from celles-ci aurait i be gone, save that to die, i laisser my love alone. 67 ah wherefore with infection devrait he live, and with his présence la grâce impiety, that sin by him avantage devrait achieve, and lace it self with his society? why devrait faux painting imitate his cheek, and voler dead seeming of his vivant hue? why devrait poor beauté indirectly seek, roses of shadow, depuis his rose is true? why devrait he live, now la nature bankrupt is, beggared of du sang to rougir par lively veins, for she hath no exchequer now but his, and fier of many, vies upon his gains? o him she stores, to show what richesse she had, in days long since, avant celles-ci last so bad. 68 thus is his joue the map of days outworn, when beauté lived and died as fleurs do now, avant celles-ci Connard signs of fair were born, or durst inhabit on a vivant brow: avant the d'or tresses of the dead, the droite of sepulchres, were shorn away, to live a seconde life on seconde head, ere beauty's dead fleece made un autre gay: in him ceux holy antique heures are seen, sans pour autant all ornament, it self and true, fabrication no été of another's green, robbing no old to dress his beauté new, and him as for a map doth la nature store, to show faux art what beauté was of yore. 69 ceux les pièces of thee that the world's eye doth view, want rien that the pensée of hearts can mend: all tongues (the voix of souls) give thee that due, uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend. thy vers l'extérieur thus with vers l'extérieur louange is crowned, but ceux same tongues that give thee so thine own, in autre accents do this louange confound by voyant plus loin than the eye hath shown. they look into the beauté of thy mind, and that in devine they mesure by thy deeds, then churls leur thoughts (although leur eyes were kind) to thy fair fleur add the rank odeur of weeds: but why thy odour matcheth not thy show, the soil is this, that thou dost commun grow. 70 that thou art blamed doit not be thy defect, for slander's mark was ever yet the fair, the ornament of beauté is suspect, a crow that mouches in heaven's sweetest air. so thou be good, calomnie doth but approve, thy vaut the greater étant wooed of time, for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love, and thou present'st a pure unstained prime. thou hast passed by the ambush of Jeune days, Soit not assailed, or victor étant charged, yet this thy louange ne peux pas be so thy praise, to tie up envy, evermore enlarged, if some suspect of ill masked not thy show, then thou seul kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe. 71 no plus long mourn for me when i am dead, than you doit hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the monde that i am fled from this vile monde with vilest worms to dwell: nay if you read this line, rappelles toi not, the hand that writ it, for i love you so, that i in your sucré thoughts aurait be forgot, if thinking on me then devrait make you woe. o if (i say) you look upon this verse, when i (perhaps) compounded am with clay, do not so much as my poor name rehearse; but let your love even with my life decay. lest the wise monde devrait look into your moan, and mock you with me après i am gone. 72 o lest the monde devrait task you to recite, what mérite lived in me that you devrait love après my décès (dear love) oublier me quite, for you in me can rien worthy prove. sauf si you aurait concevoir some virtuous lie, to do more for me than mine own desert, and hang more louange upon deceased i, than niggard vérité aurait willingly impart: o lest your true love may seem faux in this, that you for love parler well of me untrue, my name be enterré où my body is, and live no more to la honte nor me, nor you. for i am shamed by that lequel i apporter forth, and so devrait you, to love things rien worth. 73 that time of year thou mayst in me behold, when yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang upon ceux boughs lequel secouer against the cold, bare ruined choirs, où late the sucré birds sang. in me thou seest the twilight of such day, as après sunset fadeth in the west, lequel by and by noir nuit doth take away, death's seconde self that seals up all in rest. in me thou seest the glowing of such fire, that on the ashes of his jeunesse doth lie, as the death-bed, whereon it must expire, consumed with that lequel it was nourished by. this thou perceiv'st, lequel fait du thy love more strong, to love that well, lequel thou must laisser ere long. 74 but be contented when that fell arrest, sans pour autant all bail doit porter me away, my life hath in this line some interest, lequel for memorial encore with thee doit stay. when thou reviewest this, thou dost review, the very part was consecrate to thee, the Terre can have but earth, lequel is his due, my esprit is thine the mieux part of me, so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life, the prey of worms, my body étant dead, the lâche conquest of a wretch's knife, too base of thee to be remembered, the vaut of that, is that lequel it contains, and that is this, and this with thee remains. 75 so are you to my thoughts as food to life, or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground; and for the paix of you i hold such strife as 'twixt a miser and his richesse is found. now fier as an enjoyer, and anon doubting the filching age will voler his treasure, now counting best to be with you alone, then bettered that the monde may see my pleasure, parfois all full with feasting on your sight, and by and by clean starved for a look, possessing or pursuing no délice save what is had, or must from you be took. thus do i pine and surfeit day by day, or gluttoning on all, or all away. 76 why is my verse so Dénudé of new pride? so far from variation or rapide change? why with the time do i not glance de côté to new-found methods, and to compounds strange? why écrire i encore all one, ever the same, and keep invention in a noted weed, that chaque word doth presque tell my name, showing leur birth, and où they did proceed? o know sucré love i toujours écrire of you, and you and love are encore my argument: so all my best is dressing old words new, spending encore what is déjà spent: for as the sun is daily new and old, so is my love encore telling what is told. 77 thy verre will show thee how thy beauties wear, thy dial how thy précieux minutes waste, celles-ci vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear, and of this book, this learning mayst thou taste. the wrinkles lequel thy verre will vraiment show, of mouthed graves will give thee memory, thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know, time's thievish progress to eternity. look what thy Mémoire ne peux pas contain, commettre to celles-ci déchets blanks, and thou shalt find ceux children nursed, delivered from thy brain, to take a new acquaintance of thy mind. celles-ci offices, so oft as thou wilt look, doit profit thee, and much enrich thy book. 78 so oft have i invoked thee for my muse, and a trouvé such fair assistance in my verse, as chaque alien pen hath got my use, and sous thee leur poesy disperse. thine eyes, that enseigné the dumb on high to sing, and lourd ignorance aloft to fly, have added feathers to the learned's wing, and donné la grâce a double majesty. yet be most fier of that lequel i compile, dont influence is thine, and born of thee, in others' travaux thou dost but mend the style, and arts with thy sucré graces graced be. but thou art all my art, and dost advance as high as learning, my rude ignorance. 79 whilst i seul did call upon thy aid, my verse seul had all thy doux grace, but now my gracious numbers are decayed, and my sick muse doth give an autre place. i subvention (sweet love) thy charmant argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen, yet what of thee thy poet doth invent, he robs thee of, and pays it thee again, he lends thee virtue, and he stole that word, from thy behaviour, beauté doth he give and a trouvé it in thy cheek: he can afford no louange to thee, but what in thee doth live. then remercier him not for that lequel he doth say, depuis what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay. 80 o how i perdre connaissance when i of you do write, connaissance a mieux esprit doth use your name, and in the louange thereof spends all his might, to make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame. but depuis your vaut (wide as the ocean is) the humble as the proudest sail doth bear, my saucy bark (inferior far to his) on your broad main doth wilfully appear. your shallowest help will hold me up afloat, whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride, or (being wrecked) i am a worthless boat, he of tall building, and of goodly pride. then if he prospérer and i be cast away, the worst was this, my love was my decay. 81 or i doit live your epitaph to make, or you survive when i in Terre am rotten, from Par conséquent your Mémoire décès ne peux pas take, bien que in me each part will be forgotten. your name from Par conséquent immortal life doit have, bien que i (once gone) to all the monde must die, the Terre can rendement me but a commun grave, when you entombed in men's eyes doit lie, your monument doit be my doux verse, lequel eyes not yet created doit o'er-read, and tongues to be, your étant doit rehearse, when all the breathers of this monde are dead, you encore doit live (such vertu hath my pen) où souffle most breathes, even in the mouths of men. 82 i subvention thou wert not married to my muse, and par conséquent mayst sans pour autant attaint o'erlook the dedicated words lequel writers use of leur fair subject, bénédiction chaque book. thou art as fair in connaissance as in hue, finding thy vaut a limit past my praise, and par conséquent art enforced to seek anew, some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days. and do so love, yet when they have devised, what strained touches rhetoric can lend, thou vraiment fair, wert vraiment sympathized, in true plaine words, by thy true-telling friend. and leur brut painting pourrait be mieux used, où cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused. 83 i jamais saw that you did painting need, and par conséquent to your fair no painting set, i a trouvé (or pensée i found) you did exceed, that Dénudé soumissionner of a poet's debt: and par conséquent have i slept in your report, that you your self étant extant well pourrait show, how far a modern quill doth come too short, speaking of worth, what vaut in you doth grow. this silence for my sin you did impute, lequel doit be most my gloire étant dumb, for i impair not beauté étant mute, when autres aurait give life, and apporter a tomb. Là vies more life in one of your fair eyes, than both your poets can in louange devise. 84 who is it that says most, lequel can say more, than this rich praise, that you alone, are you? in dont confine immured is the store, lequel devrait example où your égal grew. lean penury dans that pen doth dwell, that to his matière lends not some petit glory, but he that writes of you, if he can tell, that you are you, so dignifies his story. let him but copy what in you is writ, not fabrication pire what la nature made so clear, and such a counterpart doit fame his wit, fabrication his style admired chaque where. you to your beauteous blessings add a curse, étant fond on praise, lequel fait du your praises worse. 85 my tongue-tied muse in manners tient her still, tandis que comments of your louange richly compiled, reserve leur character with d'or quill, and précieux phrase by all the muses filed. i pense good thoughts, whilst autre écrire good words, and like unlettered clerk encore cry amen, to chaque hymn that able esprit affords, in polished form of well refined pen. hearing you praised, i say 'tis so, 'tis true, and to the most of louange add quelque chose more, but that is in my thought, dont love to you (though words come hindmost) tient his rank before, then others, for the souffle of words respect, me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect. 86 was it the fier full sail of his génial verse, lié for the prix of (all too precious) you, that did my ripe thoughts in my cerveau inhearse, fabrication leur tomb the womb où they grew? was it his spirit, by spirits enseigné to write, au dessus a mortel pitch, that frappé me dead? no, ni he, nor his compeers by nuit donnant him aid, my verse astonished. he nor that affable familier fantôme lequel nightly gulls him with intelligence, as victors of my silence ne peux pas boast, i was not sick of any fear from thence. but when your countenance filled up his line, then lacked i matter, that enfeebled mine. 87 farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing, and like assez thou know'st thy estimate, the charter of thy vaut gives thee releasing: my bonds in thee are all determinate. for how do i hold thee but by thy granting, and for that riches où is my deserving? the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting, and so my patent back encore is swerving. thy self thou gav'st, thy own vaut then not knowing, or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking, so thy génial gift upon misprision growing, vient home again, on mieux judgement making. thus have i had thee as a rêver doth flatter, in sommeil a king, but waking no such matter. 88 when thou shalt be disposed to set me light, and endroit my mérite in the eye of scorn, upon thy side, against my self i'll fight, and prouver thee virtuous, bien que thou art forsworn: with mine own weakness étant best acquainted, upon thy part i can set down a récit of faults concealed, où i am attainted: that thou in losing me, shalt win much glory: and i by this will be a gainer too, for bending all my aimant thoughts on thee, the injuries that to my self i do, Faire thee vantage, double-vantage me. such is my love, to thee i so belong, that for thy right, my self will bear all wrong. 89 say that thou didst forsake me for some fault, and i will comment upon that offence, parler of my lameness, and i tout droit will halt: against thy reasons fabrication no defence. thou canst not (love) disgrâce me half so ill, to set a form upon desired change, as i'll my self disgrace, connaissance thy will, i will acquaintance strangle and look strange: be absent from thy walks and in my tongue, thy sucré beloved name no more doit dwell, lest i (too much profane) devrait do it wronk: and haply of our old acquaintance tell. for thee, against my self i'll vow debate, for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate. 90 then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now, now tandis que the monde is bent my actes to cross, join with the dépit of fortune, make me bow, and do not drop in for an after-loss: ah do not, when my cœur hath 'scaped this sorrow, come in the rearward of a conquered woe, give not a windy nuit a rainy morrow, to linger out a purposed overthrow. if thou wilt laisser me, do not laisser me last, when autre petty griefs have done leur spite, but in the onset come, so doit i goût at première the very worst of fortune's might. and autre strains of woe, lequel now seem woe, compared with loss of thee, will not seem so. 91 some gloire in leur birth, some in leur skill, some in leur wealth, some in leur body's force, some in leur garments bien que new-fangled ill: some in leur hawks and hounds, some in leur horse. and chaque humour hath his adjunct pleasure, où it trouve a joy au dessus the rest, but celles-ci particulars are not my measure, all celles-ci i mieux in one général best. thy love is mieux than high naissance to me, richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs, of more délice than hawks and horses be: and ayant thee, of all men's fierté i boast. wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take, all this away, and me most wretchcd make. 92 but do thy worst to voler thy self away, for term of life thou art assured mine, and life no plus long than thy love will stay, for it depends upon that love of thine. then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs, when in the moins of them my life hath end, i see, a mieux Etat to me belongs than that, lequel on thy humour doth depend. thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind, depuis that my life on thy révolte doth lie, o what a heureux Titre do i find, heureux to have thy love, heureux to die! but what's so blessed-fair that peurs no blot? thou mayst be false, and yet i know it not. 93 so doit i live, supposing thou art true, like a deceived husband, so love's face, may encore seem love to me, bien que altered new: thy regards with me, thy cœur in autre place. for Là can live no hatred in thine eye, par conséquent in that i ne peux pas know thy change, in many's looks, the faux heart's history is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange. but paradis in thy creation did decree, that in thy face sucré love devrait ever dwell, whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be, thy regards devrait rien thence, but sweetness tell. how like eve's apple doth thy beauté grow, if thy sucré vertu répondre not thy show. 94 they that have Puissance to hurt, and will do none, that do not do the thing, they most do show, who moving others, are se as stone, unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow: they rightly do inherit heaven's graces, and mari nature's riches from expense, tibey are the seigneurs and owners of leur faces, others, but stewards of leur excellence: the summer's fleur is to the été sweet, bien que to it self, it only live and die, but if that fleur with base infection meet, the basest weed outbraves his dignity: for sweetest things turn sourest by leur deeds, lilies that fester, odeur far pire than weeds. 95 how sucré and charmant dost thou make the shame, lequel like a canker in the fragrant rose, doth spot the beauté of thy budding name! o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose! that langue that raconte the récit of thy days, (making lascivious comments on thy sport) ne peux pas dispraise, but in a kind of praise, naming thy name, blesses an ill report. o what a mansion have ceux vices got, lequel for leur habitation chose out thee, où beauty's veil doth cover chaque blot, and all things se tourne to fair, that eyes can see! take heed (dear heart) of this grand privilege, the hardest couteau ill-used doth lose his edge. 96 some say thy faute is youth, some wantonness, some say thy la grâce is jeunesse and doux sport, both la grâce and faults are loved of more and less: thou mak'st faults graces, that to thee resort: as on the doigt of a throned queen, the basest bijou will be well esteemed: so are ceux errors that in thee are seen, to truths translated, and for true things deemed. how many lambs pourrait the stern wolf betray, if like a lamb he pourrait his regards translate! how many gazers mightst thou lead away, if thou wouldst use the force of all thy state! but do not so, i love thee in such sort, as thou étant mine, mine is thy good report. 97 how like a hiver hath my absence been from thee, the plaisir of the fleeting year! what freezings have i felt, what dark days seen! what old december's bareness everywhere! and yet this time removed was summer's time, the teeming autumn big with rich increase, palier the wanton fardeau of the prime, like widowed wombs après leur lords' decease: yet this abundant problème seemed to me but hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit, for été and his pleasures wait on thee, and thou away, the very birds are mute. or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer, that leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near. 98 from you have i been absent in the spring, when proud-pied april (dressed in all his trim) hath put a esprit of jeunesse in chaque thing: that lourd saturn laughed and leaped with him. yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sucré odeur of different fleurs in odour and in hue, pourrait make me any summer's récit tell: or from leur fier lap cueillir them où they grew: nor did i merveille at the lily's white, nor louange the deep vermilion in the rose, they were but sweet, but figures of delight: tiré après you, you pattern of all those. yet seemed it hiver still, and you away, as with your ombre i with celles-ci did play. 99 the vers l'avant violet thus did i chide, sucré thief, d'où didst thou voler thy sucré that smells, if not from my love's breath? the purple fierté lequel on thy soft check for complexion dwells, in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed. the lily i condemned for thy hand, and buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair, the roses fearfully on thorns did stand, one blushing shame, un autre white despair: a troisième nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both, and to his robbery had annexed thy breath, but for his theft in fierté of all his growth a vengeful canker eat him up to death. more fleurs i noted, yet i none pourrait see, but sweet, or Couleur it had stol'n from thee. 100 où art thou muse that thou forget'st so long, to parler of that lequel gives thee all thy might? spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song, darkening thy Puissance to lend base subjects light? revenir forgetful muse, and tout droit redeem, in doux numbers time so idly spent, sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem, and gives thy pen both compétence and argument. rise resty muse, my love's sucré face survey, if time have any wrinkle graven there, if any, be a satire to decay, and make time's spoils despised everywhere. give my love fame faster than time wastes life, so thou prevent'st his scythe, and crooked knife. 101 o truant muse what doit be thy amends, for thy neglect of vérité in beauté dyed? both vérité and beauté on my love depends: so dost thou too, and la bride dignified: make répondre muse, wilt thou not haply say, 'truth Besoins no Couleur with his Couleur fixed, beauté no pencil, beauty's vérité to lay: but best is best, if jamais intermixed'? car he Besoins no praise, wilt thou be dumb? excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee, to make him much outlive a gilded tomb: and to be praised of ages yet to be. then do thy Bureau muse, i enseigner thee how, to make him seem long hence, as he montre now. 102 my love is strengthened bien que more weak in seeming, i love not less, bien que less the show appear, that love is merchandized, dont rich esteeming, the owner's langue doth publish chaque where. our love was new, and then but in the spring, when i was wont to saluer it with my lays, as philomel in summer's front doth sing, and stops her pipe in growth of riper days: not that the été is less pleasant now than when her mournful hymns did hush the night, but that wild la musique burthens chaque bough, and sweets grandi commun lose leur dear delight. par conséquent like her, i parfois hold my tongue: car i aurait not dull you with my song. 103 alack what poverty my muse brings forth, that ayant such a scope to show her pride, the argument all bare is of more vaut than when it hath my added louange beside. o faire des reproches me not if i no more can write! look in your verre and Là apparaît a face, that over-goes my cru invention quite, dulling my lines, and Faire me disgrace. were it not sinful then striving to mend, to mar the matière that avant was well? for to no autre pass my verses tend, than of your graces and your gifts to tell. and more, much more than in my verse can sit, your own verre montre you, when you look in it. 104 to me fair ami you jamais can be old, for as you were when première your eye i eyed, such seems your beauté still: three winters cold, have from the forests shook three summers' pride, three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned, in process of the seasons have i seen, three april perfumes in three hot junes burned, depuis première i saw you Frais lequel yet are green. ah yet doth beauté like a dial hand, voler from his figure, and no pace perceived, so your sucré hue, lequel methinks encore doth supporter hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived. for fear of which, hear this thou age unbred, ere you were born was beauty's été dead. 105 let not my love be called idolatry, nor my beloved as an idol show, depuis all alike my songs and praises be to one, of one, encore such, and ever so. kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind, encore constant in a wondrous excellence, par conséquent my verse to constancy confined, one chose expressing, leaves out difference. fair, kind, and true, is all my argument, fair, kind, and true, varying to autre words, and in this changement is my invention spent, three themes in one, lequel wondrous scope affords. fair, kind, and true, have souvent lived alone. lequel three till now, jamais kept seat in one. 106 when in the chronicle of wasted time, i see descriptions of the fairest wights, and beauté fabrication beautiful old rhyme, in louange of Dames dead, and charmant knights, then in the blazon of sucré beauty's best, of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, i see leur antique pen aurait have expressed, even such a beauté as you Maître now. so all leur praises are but prophecies of this our time, all you prefiguring, and for they looked but with divining eyes, they had not compétence assez your vaut to sing: for we lequel now voir celles-ci présent days, have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise. 107 not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul, of the wide world, dreaming on things to come, can yet the lease of my true love control, supposed as forfeit to a confined doom. the mortel moon hath her eclipse endured, and the sad augurs mock leur own presage, incertainties now couronne se assured, and paix proclaims olives of endless age. now with the gouttes of this most balmy time, my love regards fresh, and décès to me subscribes, depuis dépit of him i'll live in this poor rhyme, tandis que he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes. and thou in this shalt find thy monument, when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent. 108 what's in the cerveau that ink may character, lequel hath not figured to thee my true spirit, what's new to speak, what now to register, that may Express my love, or thy dear merit? rien sucré boy, but yet like prières divine, i must each day say o'er the very same, counting no old chose old, thou mine, i thine, even as when première i hallowed thy fair name. so that éternel love in love's Frais case, weighs not the dust and injury of age, nor gives to necessary wrinkles place, but fait du antiquity for aye his page, finding the première conceit of love Là bred, où time and vers l'extérieur form aurait show it dead. 109 o jamais say that i was faux of heart, bien que absence seemed my flame to qualify, as easy pourrait i from my self depart, as from my soul lequel in thy Sein doth lie: that is my home of love, if i have ranged, like him that travels i revenir again, just to the time, not with the time exchanged, so that my self apporter eau for my stain, jamais croyez bien que in my la nature reigned, all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood, that it pourrait so preposterously be stained, to laisser for rien all thy sum of good: for rien this wide universe i call, save thou my rose, in it thou art my all. 110 alas 'tis true, i have gone here and there, and made my self a motley to the view, gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear, made old offences of affections new. most true it is, that i have looked on vérité askance and strangely: but by all above, celles-ci blenches gave my cœur un autre youth, and pire essays proved thee my best of love. now all is done, have what doit have no end, mine appetite i jamais more will grind on newer proof, to try an older friend, a god in love, to whom i am confined. then give me welcome, next my paradis the best, even to thy pure and most most aimant breast. 111 o for my sake do you with fortune chide, the coupable goddess of my harmful deeds, that did not mieux for my life provide, than Publique veux dire lequel Publique manners breeds. thence vient it that my name receives a brand, and presque thence my la nature is subdued to what it travaux in, like the dyer's hand: pity me then, and wish i were renewed, whilst like a prêt patient i will drink, potions of eisel 'gainst my fort infection, no bitterness that i will amer think, nor double penance to correct correction. pity me then dear friend, and i assurer ye, even that your pity is assez to cure me. 112 your love and pity doth th' impression fill, lequel vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow, for what care i who calls me well or ill, so you o'er-green my bad, my good allow? you are my all the world, and i must strive, to know my shames and praises from your tongue, none else to me, nor i to none alive, that my steeled sens or changes droite or wrong. in so profound abysm i jeter all care of others' voices, that my adder's sense, to critic and to flatterer stopped are: mark how with my neglect i do dispense. you are so strongly in my objectif bred, that all the monde outre methinks are dead. 113 depuis i left you, mine eye is in my mind, and that lequel governs me to go about, doth part his function, and is partiellement blind, seems seeing, but effectually is out: for it no form delivers to the cœur of bird, of flower, or forme lequel it doth latch, of his rapide objects hath the mind no part, nor his own vision tient what it doth catch: for if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight, the most sucré favoriser or deformed'st creature, the mountain, or the sea, the day, or night: the crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature. incapable of more, replete with you, my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue. 114 or qu'il s'agisse doth my mind étant crowned with you boisson up the monarch's peste this flattery? or qu'il s'agisse doit i say mine eye saith true, and that your love enseigné it this alchemy? to make of monsters, and things indigest, such cherubins as your sucré self resemble, creating chaque bad a parfait best as fast as objects to his beams assemble: o 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing, and my génial mind most kingly drinks it up, mine eye well sait what with his gust is 'greeing, and to his palate doth préparer the cup. if it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin, that mine eye aime it and doth première begin. 115 ceux lines that i avant have writ do lie, even ceux that said i pourrait not love you dearer, yet then my jugement knew no raison why, my most full flame devrait ensuite burn clearer, but reckoning time, dont millioned accidents creep in 'twixt vows, and changement decrees of kings, tan sacré beauty, cru the sharp'st intents, divert fort esprits to the cours of alt'ring things: alas why fearing of time's tyranny, pourrait i not then say 'now i love you best,' when i was certain o'er incertainty, crowning the present, doubting of the rest? love is a babe, then pourrait i not say so to give full growth to that lequel encore doth grow. 116 let me not to the mariage of true esprits admit impediments, love is not love lequel alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove. o no, it is an ever-fixed mark that regards on tempests and is jamais shaken; it is the star to chaque wand'ring bark, dont worth's unknown, bien que his height be taken. love's not time's fool, bien que rosy lips and cheeks dans his bending sickle's compass come, love alters not with his bref heures and weeks, but ours it out even to the edge of doom: if this be error and upon me proved, i jamais writ, nor no man ever loved. 117 accuser me thus, that i have scanted all, où i devrait your génial deserts repay, forgot upon your très cher love to call, whereto all bonds do tie me day by day, that i have frequent been with inconnue minds, and donné to time your own dear-purchased right, that i have hoisted sail to all the winds lequel devrait transport me farthest from your sight. book both my wilfulness and errors down, and on just preuve surmise, accumulate, apporter me dans the level of your frown, but shoot not at me in your wakened hate: depuis my appeal says i did strive to prouver the constancy and vertu of your love. 118 like as to make our appetite more keen with eager compounds we our palate urge, as to prevent our maladies unseen, we sicken to shun maladie when we purge. even so étant full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness, to amer sauces did i Cadre my feeding; and sick of welfare a trouvé a kind of meetness, to be diseased ere that Là was true needing. thus politique in love t' anticipate the ills that were not, grew to faults assured, and apporté to medicine a healthful Etat lequel rank of la bonté aurait by ill be cured. but thence i apprendre and find the lesson true, drugs poison him that so feil sick of you. 119 what potions have i ivre of siren larmes distilled from limbecks foul as hell within, applying peurs to hopes, and hopes to fears, encore losing when i saw my self to win! what wretched errors hath my cœur committed, whilst it hath pensée it self so blessed never! how have mine eyes out of leur spheres been fitted in the distraction of this madding fever! o avantage of ill, now i find true that mieux is, by evil encore made better. and ruined love when it is built anew grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater. so i revenir rebuked to my content, and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent. 120 that you were once unkind befriends me now, and for that sorrow, lequel i then did feel, Besoins must i sous my transgression bow, sauf si my nerves were brass or hammered steel. for if you were by my unkindness shaken as i by yours, y'have passed a hell of time, and i a tyran have no loisir pris to weigh how once i suffered in your crime. o that our nuit of woe pourrait have remembered my deepest sense, how hard true chagrin hits, and soon to you, as you to me then tendered the humble salve, lequel blessés bosoms fits! but that your trespass now becomes a fee, mine ransoms yours, and le tiens must une rançon me. 121 'tis mieux to be vile than vile esteemed, when not to be, receives reproach of being, and the just plaisir lost, lequel is so deemed, not by our feeling, but by others' seeing. for why devrait others' faux adulterate eyes give salutation to my sportive blood? or on my frailties why are frailer spies, lequel in leur wills compter bad what i pense good? no, i am that i am, and they that level at my abuses, reckon up leur own, i may be tout droit bien que they se be bevel; by leur rank thoughts, my actes must not be shown sauf si this général evil they maintain, all men are bad and in leur badness reign. 122 thy gift, thy tables, are dans my cerveau full charactered with lasting memory, lequel doit au dessus that idle rank rester au-delà all date even to eternity. or at the least, so long as cerveau and cœur have faculty by la nature to subsist, till each to razed oblivion rendement his part of thee, thy record jamais can be missed: that poor retention pourrait not so much hold, nor need i tallies thy dear love to score, par conséquent to give them from me was i bold, to confiance ceux tables that recevoir thee more: to keep an adjunct to rappelles toi thee were to import forgetfulness in me. 123 no! time, thou shalt not boast that i do change, thy pyramids built up with newer pourrait to me are rien novel, rien strange, they are but dressings of a ancien sight: our dates are brief, and par conséquent we admire, what thou dost foist upon us that is old, and plutôt make them born to our desire, than pense that we avant have entendu them told: thy registers and thee i both defy, not wond'ring at the present, nor the past, for thy records, and what we see doth lie, made more or less by thy continual haste: this i do vow and this doit ever be, i will be true malgré thy scythe and thee. 124 if my dear love were but the enfant of state, it pourrait for fortune's Connard be unfathered, as matière to time's love or to time's hate, mauvaises herbes among weeds, or fleurs with fleurs gathered. no it was builded far from accident, it suffers not in smiling pomp, nor des chutes sous the blow of thralled discontent, whereto th' inviting time our mode calls: it peurs not politique that heretic, lequel travaux on leases of short-numbered hours, but all seul stands hugely politic, that it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers. to this i témoin call the imbéciles of time, lequel die for goodness, who have lived for crime. 125 were't aught to me i bore the canopy, with my extern the vers l'extérieur honouring, or laid génial bases for eternity, lequel proves more court than déchets or ruining? have i not seen dwellers on form and favoriser lose all, and more by paying too much rent for compound sweet; forgoing Facile savour, pitiful thrivers in leur gazing spent? no, let me be obsequious in thy heart, and take thou my oblation, poor but free, lequel is not mixed with seconds, sait no art, but mutual render, only me for thee. hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul when most impeached, stands moins in thy control. 126 o thou my charmant boy who in thy power, dost hold time's fickle verre his fickle hour: who hast by waning grown, and la bride show'st, thy les amoureux withering, as thy sucré self grow'st. if la nature (sovereign maîtresse over wrack) as thou goest onwards encore will cueillir thee back, she garde thee to this purpose, that her compétence may time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill. yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure, she may detain, but not encore keep her treasure! her audit (though delayed) answered must be, and her quietus is to rendre thee. 127 in the old age noir was not counted fair, or if it were it bore not beauty's name: but now is noir beauty's successive heir, and beauté slandered with a Connard shame, for depuis each hand hath put on nature's power, fairing the foul with art's faux borrowed face, sucré beauté hath no name no holy bower, but is profaned, if not vies in disgrace. par conséquent my mistress' eyes are raven black, her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem, at such who not born fair no beauté lack, slandering creation with a faux esteem, yet so they mourn becoming of leur woe, that chaque langue says beauté devrait look so. 128 how oft when thou, my music, la musique play'st, upon that blessed wood dont mouvement sounds with thy sucré fingers when thou gently sway'st the wiry concord that mine ear confounds, do i envy ceux jacks that nimble leap, to kiss the soumissionner inward of thy hand, whilst my poor lips lequel devrait that harvest reap, at the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand. to be so tickled they aurait changement leur Etat and situation with ceux dancing chips, o'er whom thy fingers walk with doux gait, fabrication dead wood more heureux than vivant lips, depuis saucy jacks so heureux are in this, give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss. 129 th' expense of esprit in a déchets of la honte is lust in action, and till action, lust is perjured, murd'rous, bloody full of blame, savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust, enjoyed no plus tôt but despised straight, past raison hunted, and no plus tôt had past raison hated as a swallowed bait, on objectif laid to make the taker mad. mad in pursuit and in possession so, had, having, and in quest, to have extreme, a bliss in preuve and proved, a very woe, avant a joy proposed derrière a dream. all this the monde well sait yet none sait well, to shun the paradis that leads men to this hell. 130 my mistress' eyes are rien like the sun, coral is far more red, than her lips red, if snow be white, why then her breasts are dun: if hairs be wires, noir wires grow on her head: i have seen roses damasked, red and white, but no such roses see i in her cheeks, and in some perfumes is Là more delight, than in the souffle that from my maîtresse reeks. i love to hear her speak, yet well i know, that la musique hath a far more pleasing sound: i subvention i jamais saw a goddess go, my maîtresse when she walks treads on the ground. and yet by paradis i pense my love as rare, as any she belied with faux compare. 131 thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art, as ceux dont beauties proudly make them cruel; for well thou know'st to my dear doting cœur thou art the fairest and most précieux jewel. yet in good Foi some say that thee behold, thy face hath not the Puissance to make love groan; to say they err, i dare not be so bold, bien que i jurer it to my self alone. and to be sure that is not faux i swear, a thousand groans but thinking on thy face, one on another's neck do témoin bear thy noir is fairest in my judgment's place. in rien art thou noir save in thy deeds, and thence this calomnie as i pense proceeds. 132 thine eyes i love, and they as pitying me, connaissance thy cœur torment me with disdain, have put on black, and aimant mourners be, looking with jolie ruth upon my pain. and vraiment not the Matin sun of paradis mieux becomes the grey cheeks of the east, nor that full star that ushers in the even doth half that gloire to the sober west as ceux two mourning eyes devenir thy face: o let it then as well beseem thy cœur to mourn for me depuis mourning doth thee grace, and suit thy pity like in chaque part. then will i jurer beauté se is black, and all they foul that thy complexion lack. 133 beshrew that cœur that fait du my cœur to groan for that deep blessure it gives my ami and me; is't not assez to torture me alone, but esclave to slavery my sweet'st ami must be? me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken, and my next self thou harder hast engrossed, of him, my self, and thee i am forsaken, a torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed: prison my cœur in thy acier bosom's ward, but then my friend's cœur let my poor cœur bail, whoe'er garde me, let my cœur be his guard, thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol. and yet thou wilt, for i étant pent in thee, perforce am thine and all that is in me. 134 so now i have confessed that he is thine, and i my self am mortgaged to thy will, my self i'll forfeit, so that autre mine, thou wilt restore to be my confort still: but thou wilt not, nor he will not be free, for thou art covetous, and he is kind, he appris but surety-like to écrire for me, sous that bond that him as fist doth bind. the statute of thy beauté thou wilt take, thou usurer that put'st en avant all to use, and sue a friend, came debtor for my sake, so him i lose par my unkind abuse. him have i lost, thou hast both him and me, he pays the whole, and yet am i not free. 135 whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will, and 'will' to boot, and 'will' in over-plus, more than assez am i that vex thee still, to thy sucré will fabrication addition thus. wilt thou dont will is grand and spacious, not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine? doit will in autres seem droite gracious, and in my will no fair acceptance shine? the sea all water, yet receives rain still, and in abundance addeth to his store, so thou étant rich in will add to thy will one will of mine to make thy grand will more. let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill, pense all but one, and me in that one 'will.' 136 if thy soul check thee that i come so near, jurer to thy aveugle soul that i was thy 'will', and will thy soul sait is admitted there, thus far for love, my love-suit sucré fulfil. 'will', will fulfil the Trésor of thy love, ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one, in things of génial receipt with case we prove, among a nombre one is reckoned none. then in the nombre let me pass untold, bien que in thy store's Compte i one must be, for rien hold me, so it S'il vous plaît thee hold, that rien me, a quelque chose sucré to thee. make but my name thy love, and love that still, and then thou lov'st me for my name is will. 137 thou aveugle fool love, what dost thou to mine eyes, that they voir and see not what they see? they know what beauté is, see où it lies, yet what the best is, take the worst to be. if eyes corrupt by over-partial looks, be anchored in the bay où all men ride, why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks, whereto the jugement of my cœur is tied? why devrait my cœur pense that a nombreuses plot, lequel my cœur sait the wide world's commun place? or mine eyes voyant this, say this is not to put fair vérité upon so foul a face? in things droite true my cœur and eyes have erred, and to this faux peste are they now transferred. 138 when my love swears that she is made of truth, i do croyez her bien que i know she lies, that she pourrait pense me some untutored youth, unlearned in the world's faux subtleties. thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, bien que she sait my days are past the best, simply i crédit her false-speaking tongue, on both sides thus is Facile vérité suppressed: but wherefore says she not she is unjust? and wherefore say not i that i am old? o love's best habitude is in seeming trust, and age in love, aime not to have years told. par conséquent i lie with her, and she with me, and in our faults by lies we flattered be. 139 o call not me to justify the wrong, that thy unkindness lays upon my heart, blessure me not with thine eye but with thy tongue, use Puissance with power, and slay me not by art, tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight, dear cœur ancêtre to glance thine eye aside, what need'st thou blessure with ruse when thy pourrait is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide? let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows, her jolie regards have been mine enemies, and par conséquent from my face she se tourne my foes, that they elsewhere pourrait dart leur injuries: yet do not so, but depuis i am near slain, kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain. 140 be wise as thou art cruel, do not press my tongue-tied la patience with too much disdain: lest chagrin lend me words and words express, the manière of my pity-wanting pain. if i pourrait enseigner thee wit mieux it were, bien que not to love, yet love to tell me so, as testy sick men when leur deaths be near, no news but santé from leur physicians know. for if i devrait désespoir i devrait grow mad, and in my la démence pourrait parler ill of thee, now this ill-wresting monde is grandi so bad, mad slanderers by mad ears believed be. that i may not be so, nor thou belied, bear thine eyes straight, bien que thy fier cœur go wide. 141 in Foi i do not love thee with mine eyes, for they in thee a thousand errors note, but 'tis my cœur that aime what they despise, who in malgré of view is pleased to dote. nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted, nor soumissionner feeling to base touches prone, nor taste, nor smell, le désir to be invited to any sensual le banquet with thee alone: but my five wits, nor my five senses can dissuade one insensé cœur from serving thee, who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man, thy fier heart's esclave and vassal misérable to be: only my peste thus far i compter my gain, that she that fait du me sin, awards me pain. 142 love is my sin, and thy dear vertu hate, hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving, o but with mine, compare thou thine own state, and thou shalt find it merits not reproving, or if it do, not from ceux lips of thine, that have profaned leur scarlet ornaments, and sealed faux bonds of love as oft as mine, robbed others' beds' revenues of leur rents. be it légitime i love thee as thou lov'st those, whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee, root pity in thy cœur that when it grows, thy pity may mériter to pitied be. if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide, by self-example mayst thou be denied. 143 lo as a careful huswife runs to catch, one of her feathered creatures cassé away, sets down her babe and fait du all rapide envoi in pursuit of the chose she aurait have stay: whilst her neglected enfant tient her in chase, cries to capture her dont busy care is bent, to suivre that lequel mouches avant her face: not prizing her poor infant's discontent; so run'st thou après that lequel mouches from thee, whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind, but if thou capture thy hope turn back to me: and play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind. so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will, if thou turn back and my loud crying still. 144 two aime i have of confort and despair, lequel like two spirits do suggest me still, the mieux ange is a man droite fair: the worser esprit a femme coloured ill. to win me soon to hell my female evil, tempteth my mieux ange from my side, and aurait corrupt my Saint to be a devil: wooing his purity with her foul pride. and qu'il s'agisse that my ange be turned fiend, suspect i may, yet not directly tell, but étant both from me both to each friend, i devine one ange in another's hell. yet this doit i ne'er know but live in doubt, till my bad ange fire my good one out. 145 ceux lips that love's own hand did make, breathed en avant the du son that said 'i hate', to me that languished for her sake: but when she saw my woeful state, tout droit in her cœur did pitié come, chiding that langue that ever sweet, was used in donnant doux doom: and enseigné it thus anew to greet: 'i hate' she altered with an end, that followed it as doux day, doth suivre nuit who like a démon from paradis to hell is flown away. 'i hate', from hate away she threw, and saved my life en disant 'not you'. 146 poor soul the centre of my sinful earth, my sinful Terre celles-ci rebel powers array, why dost thou pine dans and souffrir dearth painting thy vers l'extérieur des murs so costly gay? why so grand cost ayant so court a lease, dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend? doit worms inheritors of this excess eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end? then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss, and let that pine to aggravate thy store; buy termes Divin in selling heures of dross; dans be fed, sans pour autant be rich no more, so doit thou feed on death, that feeds on men, and décès once dead, there's no more en train de mourir then. 147 my love is as a fever longing still, for that lequel plus long nurseth the disease, feeding on that lequel doth preserve the ill, th' uncertain sickly appetite to please: my raison the physician to my love, angry that his prescriptions are not kept hath left me, and i désespéré now approve, le désir is death, lequel physic did except. past cure i am, now raison is past care, and frantic-mad with evermore unrest, my thoughts and my discours as mad men's are, at random from the vérité vainly expressed. for i have juré thee fair, and pensée thee bright, who art as noir as hell, as dark as night. 148 o me! what eyes hath love put in my head, lequel have no correspondence with true sight, or if they have, où is my jugement fled, that censures falsely what they see aright? if that be fair whereon my faux eyes dote, what veux dire the monde to say it is not so? if it be not, then love doth well denote, love's eye is not so true as all men's: no, how can it? o how can love's eye be true, that is so vexed with watching and with tears? no marvel then bien que i erreur my view, the sun it self sees not, till paradis clears. o ruse love, with larmes thou keep'st me blind, lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults devrait find. 149 canst thou o cruel, say i love thee not, when i against my self with thee partake? do i not pense on thee when i forgot am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake? who hateth thee that i do call my friend, on whom frown'st thou that i do fawn upon, nay if thou lour'st on me do i not dépenser vengeance upon my self with présent moan? what mérite do i in my self respect, that is so fier thy un service to despise, when all my best doth culte thy defect, commandé by the mouvement of thine eyes? but love hate on for now i know thy mind, ceux that can see thou lov'st, and i am blind. 150 o from what Puissance hast thou this powerful might, with insufficiency my cœur to sway, to make me give the lie to my true sight, and jurer that brightness doth not la grâce the day? d'où hast thou this becoming of things ill, that in the very refuse of thy deeds, Là is such force and warrantise of skill, that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds? who enseigné thee how to make me love thee more, the more i hear and see just cause of hate? o bien que i love what autres do abhor, with autres thou shouldst not abhor my state. if thy unworthiness raised love in me, more worthy i to be beloved of thee. 151 love is too Jeune to know what conscience is, yet who sait not conscience is born of love? then doux cheater urge not my amiss, lest coupable of my faults thy sucré self prove. for thou betraying me, i do trahir my nobler part to my brut body's treason, my soul doth tell my body that he may, triomphe in love, la chair stays no plus loin reason, but rising at thy name doth point out thee, as his triumphant prize, fier of this pride, he is contented thy poor drudge to be, to supporter in thy affairs, fall by thy side. no want of conscience hold it that i call, her love, for dont dear love i rise and fall. 152 in aimant thee thou know'st i am forsworn, but thou art deux fois forsworn to me love swearing, in act thy bed-vow cassé and new Foi torn, in vowing new hate après new love bearing: but why of two oaths' breach do i accuser thee, when i break twenty?

'twere all one that i devrait love a brillant particulier star and pense to wed it, he is so au dessus me. in his brillant radiance and collateral lumière must i be comforted, not in his sphere. th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself: the hind that aurait be mated by the lion must die for love. 'twas pretty, bien que a plague, to see him chaque hour; to sit and draw his arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, in our heart's table-heart too capable of chaque line and tour of his sucré favour. but now he's gone, and my idolatrous fantaisie must sanctify his relics. who vient here? entrer parolles [aside] one that goes with him. i love him for his sake; and yet i know him a notorious liar, pense him a génial way fool, solely a coward; yet celles-ci fix'd evils sit so fit in him that they take endroit when virtue's steely des os regards bleak i' th' cold wind; withal, full oft we see cold sagesse waiting on superfluous folly. parolles. save you, fair queen! helena. and you, monarch! parolles. no. helena. and no. parolles. are you meditating on virginity? helena. ay. you have some tache of soldat in you; let me ask you a question. man is ennemi to virginity; how may we barricado it against him? parolles. keep him out. helena. but he assails; and our virginity, bien que vaillant in the defence, yet is weak. unfold to us some guerrier resistance. parolles.

'tis too cold a companion; away with't. helena. i will supporter for 't a little, bien que par conséquent i die a virgin. parolles. there's peu can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule of nature. to parler on the part of virginity is to accuser your mothers; lequel is most infallible disobedience. he that bloque himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and devrait be enterré in highways, out of all sanctified limit, as a désespéré offendress against nature. virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes lui-même to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, lequel is the most inhibited sin in the canon. keep it not; you ne peux pas choose but lose by't. out with't. dans ten year it will make lui-même ten, lequel is a goodly increase; and the principal lui-même not much the worse. away with't. helena. how pourrait one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking? parolles. let me see. marry, ill to like him that ne'er it likes. 'tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the plus long kept, the less worth. off with't tandis que 'tis vendible; répondre the time of request. virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly suited but unsuitable; just like the brooch and the toothpick, lequel wear not now. your date is mieux in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek. and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our français wither'd pears: it regards ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a wither'd pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a wither'd pear. will you n'importe quoi with it? helena. not my virginity yet. Là doit your Maître have a thousand loves, a mother, and a mistress, and a friend, a phoenix, captain, and an enemy, a guide, a goddess, and a sovereign, a counsellor, a traitress, and a dear; his humble ambition, fier humility, his jarring concord, and his discord dulcet, his faith, his sucré disaster; with a monde of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms that blinking Cupidon gossips. now doit he- i know not what he shall. god send him well! the court's a learning-place, and he is one- parolles. what one, i' faith? helena. that i wish well.
